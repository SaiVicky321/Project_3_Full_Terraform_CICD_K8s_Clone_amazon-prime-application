# Without: 
# If you don't set cluster_endpoint_public_access = true, the EKS cluster's API endpoint will be private by default.

# CoreDNS: 
# Without it, DNS resolution for Kubernetes services inside the cluster wonâ€™t work. 
# This is a crucial component for service discovery and internal communications.

# Kube-Proxy: 
# Without kube-proxy, networking between pods and services would be incomplete. 
# It is responsible for managing networking rules for services and pods in Kubernetes.

# VPC CNI: 
# Without the VPC CNI plugin, your pods will not have network connectivity using the VPC's IP addresses. 
# The VPC CNI plugin allows Kubernetes pods to receive IP addresses directly from the VPC subnet,
# which is crucial for pod communication and network routing.

# eks_managed_node_groups:
# Without: If you don't configure the node group, your EKS cluster won't have any worker nodes to run Kubernetes workloads. 
# You would either have to manually create EC2 instances and configure them as worker nodes, or use a different method 
# to provision worker nodes.
# Without a configured node group, the EKS cluster will not be able to run workloads. 
# You will also miss out on key features like node autoscaling and resource tagging.
