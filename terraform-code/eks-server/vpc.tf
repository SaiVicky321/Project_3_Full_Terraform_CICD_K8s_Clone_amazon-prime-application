# enable_nat_gateway = true: Creates a NAT Gateway in the public subnet, allowing private subnet resources to access the internet. 
# If not used, private subnets wonâ€™t have outbound internet access unless you configure another method.

# public_subnet_tags and private_subnet_tags: These tags help Kubernetes (or your infrastructure) identify which subnets are 
# intended for public-facing ELBs and which are for internal ELBs. 
# Without these tags, you would need to manage load balancers manually, and services may not work as intended.
